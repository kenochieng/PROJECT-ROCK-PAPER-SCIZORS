/* STEP1: create a function computerPlay to
generate a random answer from the three choices
"Rock,Paper or Scssors" */

The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and 
computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the

 /*NOTE THAT: Important note: you want to return the results of this function call,
  not console.log() them. To test this function console.log the results: */



  /*STEP4: Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of 
  this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports
   a winner or loser at the end. call function 5 times or use loop */
